### Resources
This is a list of resources on deep learning

#### Programming Tools

##### [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN)
NVIDIA cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. It emphasizes performance, ease-of-use, and low memory overhead. NVIDIA cuDNN is designed to be integrated into higher-level machine learning frameworks, such as UC Berkeleyâ€™s popular Caffe software. 

##### [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
Caffe is a C/C++ deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.

##### [Cuda-convnet2](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet2/)
This is a fast C++/CUDA implementation of convolutional (or more generally, feed-forward) neural networks. It can model arbitrary layer connectivity and network depth. Any directed acyclic graph of layers will do. Training is done using the back-propagation algorithm.

##### [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. You can find here a [tutorial](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials).

##### [Torch](http://torch.ch/) 
Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and efficient, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation.
